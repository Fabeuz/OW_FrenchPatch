# OW_FrenchPatch
French localization for Old World game. (WIP, plenty to translate)

Feel free to contribute.

Text files references can be found at C:\Program Files\Epic Games\OldWorldTestBranch\Reference\XML or C:\Program Files\Epic Games\OldWorld\Reference\XML

There the text-something.xml contains the text you need to change. Some text is still hardcoded and not present in these files.

# Installation and use

Download these files and put them in D:\User\Documents\my games\OldWorld\Test\Mods D:\User\Documents\my games\OldWorld\Mods (or similar).
Launch Old World, set up a new game and go into Advanced Setup to find the mod and enable it. 
Start the game and go into Options -> UI -> Languages -> French (France) and save.

Ready to play in French !

If you want to load an existing game you probably still need to launch a new game with mod and then load your save so that the mod is enabled.

# Be aware

When starting Old World, it will looks for the latest used language. If this one is French, because it is not included yet in basegame and mods will not have loaded, Old World won't find it and so switch language to DEBUG. This will cause text to not be localised until you set language to English or another language
